What is Bitweb?
------------------

Bitweb is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitweb uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitweb Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitweb Core software, **[see Release](https://github.com/SACSaveCoin/BTE/releases)**.
